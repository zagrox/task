# Task Manager
Where AI and Human Collaboration Unite.
TaskUnity is an intelligent, AI-enhanced task management system designed for seamless collaboration across multiple projects. It empowers teams to work independently while maintaining synchronized issue tracking through a centralized Git hub.


## Description
